<h2>Customization Hacks: Make Your Meal Your Own</h2>
<p>One of Panera's best features is the ability to customize your order. Here are some top hacks to get exactly what you crave:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bagel Bread Swap:</strong> Upgrade your sandwich by swapping the standard bread for your favorite Panera bagel. This works especially well with the Pick Two menu.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>DIY French Dip:</strong> Start with a baguette sandwich, swap chicken for steak, and ask for horseradish sauce instead of buffalo for a French dip twist.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Recreate Old Favorites:</strong> Miss the Sierra Turkey Sandwich? Order a Roasted Turkey sandwich, remove extras, add chipotle sauce and red onions, and swap the bread for an Asiago bagel.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mac & Cheese Upgrade:</strong> Order a mac & cheese and a salad, then combine ingredients from both for a custom bowl-think salsa, cilantro, or avocado from the Baja Bowl.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mix and Match Sides:</strong> Choose apple slices, chips, or a baguette as your side to balance out your meal.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> You can make up to five customizations per order, so get creative and build your perfect meal!</p>
